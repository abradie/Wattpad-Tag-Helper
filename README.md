```
Result: 
Open a new page with the following adress
https://www.wattpad.com/search/%23romance%20%23lgbt%20%23boss%20-teen
Equivalent to typing this on search box: "#romance #lgbt #boss -teen"
```
Main feature is [the tags](tag_counts.json) recommendations, which suggests tags in order of popularity. Sadly, i could only scrape around 1000 tags.
